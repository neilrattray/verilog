# C Code
### Run reference
To run AlexNet:

```
python resize.py {filename}
make alex_model
./model
```

To run MNIST:

```

make mnist_model
./model
```
### Setup pytorch (our customizable package, the real package name is torch)
Run the following commands to build essential packages for data extraction.
CAUTION: run these commands inside virtual environment for safety reasons. Default env is (base))
````
conda activate
python setup.py develop
````
To remove the package
````
bash cleanup
````

### Test accuracy
Run the following commands
in ````paramater_extraction/architecture_to_test/benchmark_data/````, run
````
conda activate
python create_dataset_folders.py
````
then execute ````./test.o```` in mnist folder. When done, delete all images in ````paramater_extraction/architecture_to_test/benchmark_data/````
before git.

* Test on 200 images for MNIST C implementation shows accuracy of 95.5% . Real
accuracy from Pytorch is 93% .There are memory leaks so do not run too many test cases.

# Verilog Code
### Status
Bfloat16 format is implemented on multiplier and adder. Exhaustive testbench is needed
to validate the implementation. Verilog is currently synthesize thanks to ````yosys````.
Images are at highest resolution, download them to have zoom in. ````dot```` files are
also available inside ````\image```` for interactive sessions.

### Adder
![Adder 32](./image/add.jpg)

### Multiplier
##### Adder 32
![Adder 32](./image/32.jpg)

This is Full-Adder circuit used in ````bfloat_mantisa_mult.v````. This circuit is
used for adding the first and second place binary bits after encoding.

##### 4-2 Compressor
![Adder 42](./image/42.jpg)

This is Adder circuit used in ````bfloat_mantisa_mult.v```` for the next 10 binary bits
after encoding.

##### Booth Encoder
![Booth encoder](./image/encoder.jpg)

This is booth encoding lookup table to transform ````b```` in ````a * b = c````
into partial products. ````a```` can be rewritten in terms of these partial products
and ````adder32.v````, ````adder42.v```` are used to sum them.

##### Mantissa Integer Multiplier
![mantissa](./image/mantisa.jpg)

The previous 3 circuits make up the Mantissa Integer Multiplier. This circuit takes
3 clock cycle to warm-up and produce 1 product per cycle through pipelining.

##### Bfloat16 Multiplier
![mult](./image/mult.jpg)

This circuit finishes the equation by resolving sign and exponent bits. It also
truncate the product of ````bfloat_mantisa_mult.v```` to comply with bfloat16 format.
